                                            Restcountries & Weather using fetch API
Implement the rest countries and Open weather map APIs using fetch() API.
All your HTML elements should be created with DOM.
Use only fetch() API to get both rest countries' data and open weather.
Pass the necessary value from the rest countries' API to openweathermap.org to get the current weather data of the selected country.
Use Bootstrap cards to display the necessary data on the screen.
